# Wine-Quality-detector-using-random-forest
The Wine Quality Detector leverages a Random Forest model to predict the quality of wine on a scale from 0 to 10, based on 11 physicochemical properties: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. The main libraries used in this project are Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. By analyzing these chemical attributes, the model can accurately assess wine quality, aiding in quality control and selection processes. This tool is valuable for winemakers and distributors seeking to maintain high standards in their products.
